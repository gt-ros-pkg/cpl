      Utility for calibrating cameras and RGB-D sensors to a robot arm
      holding a checkerboard.  The optimization procedure takes a set of 
      3D checkerboard corner detections and corresponding end effector
      poses to find the both, the transformation between the end effector 
      and the checkerboard frame, and the transformation between the /base_link
      and the sensor's frame. The assumption is that the pose of the checkerboard
      with respect to the end effector is fixed, and that enough samples are obtained
      such that the checkerboard offset can be uniquely determined.  In practice,
      having over 12 checkerboard captures is recommended such that all 6 degrees of 
      freedom of its pose are expressed in the sensor.
